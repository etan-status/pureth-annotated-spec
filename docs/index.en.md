## Communication

The main communication channel is a Signal group to coordinate with [EPF cohort 6](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-six).

There is a biweekly call on every other Tuesday, 14:00 UTC on [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/CompulsoryCentresBidBroadly), with [summaries](./meetings.md) available.
