## Communication

The main communication channel is a [Signal group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIGFv7odMeToP707bqsjqYEcVN3_1Rg_ATLaLHde67FQUEhC5ld5NQbeSNxO95onTrYiM) to coordinate with [EPF cohort 6](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-six).

There is a biweekly call on every other Tuesday, 14:00 UTC on [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/CompulsoryCentresBidBroadly), with [summaries](./meetings.md) available.
